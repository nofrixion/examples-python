# Python Examples
This repository contains Python code examples using the MoneyMoov API. The examples are written to operate in the [NoFrixion sandbox environment](https://docs.nofrixion.com/reference/sandbox).

Each subfolder contains examples of the api endpoints associated with a group of functions:

- accounts: list accounts and account transactions
- metadata: useful for API troubleshooting and diagnostics
- payouts: endpoints for creating and approving payouts (the sending of funds)
- transfers: send funds between accounts belonging to the same merchant
- user: reading and updating user profiles, associated merchants and creating and refreshing access tokens

We will continue adding examples as the API develops. For more details see our [API documentation](https://docs.nofrixion.com)

## Python environment

The examples in this repository were developed and tested using Python 3.10. The code is fairly generic and should be easily adaptable to a variety of Python implementations and frameworks.
